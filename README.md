# Quem necessita?

The project "Quem necessita?" aims to exercise practicality by creating a website that displays the places that need donation in a dynamic and efficient way, so that those who donate can find the ideal institution for their donation and those who receive feel welcomed and close to their donor.

It is part of the authors' objectives to develop a software that contains features that accompany the user throughout the execution of the donation, allowing interaction between users and integrating institutions interested in it into the system.
